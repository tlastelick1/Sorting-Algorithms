# Sorting-Algorithms
selection sort, merge sort, and insertion sort

-In Lab 13 you added the selectionSort functions to the class arrayList.h. Add the functionality to the array class that will also allow for sorting the data in descending order.  

-Refer to the provided clockTypeclass in clockType.hand the driver file hw8main.cpp. Make the proper changes for the code towork with the sorting function in the array class.  Use the sample data in the provided driver file to test your code.  Print the original list of clocks, the list sorted in ascending order and the list sorted in descending order.

Linked list-based lists sorting (Lab 13)

-Add the mergesort to the class defined in the linkedQueueType.h file.  Insert the data from lab13.dat to your list object.  

-In the same driver file, hw8main.cpp, test your linked list mergesortfunction.  

-Print the sorted list, the number of comparisons, and the number of data moves.  

-Do the same with the insertion sort (linked list version).

Notes and Requirements:
-Number of comparisonsand number of data movesshould be private members in the classes. 
-Make sure they are initialized to 0 in the constructor.
-You must start with the original unsorted list each time.
